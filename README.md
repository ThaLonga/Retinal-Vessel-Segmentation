# Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation
Final project for the elective course Deep Learning at Ghent University
Different U-Net architectures were tested on the DRIVE dataset (containing retina images) for segmenting the blood vessels. CMP-UNet demonstrated the best performance. This code was originally ran in google Colab.
